# 🔄 3x3 Matrix Transposer

This C++ program creates a 3x3 matrix filled with ordered numbers from 1 to 9, then generates and prints its transposed version.

## 🚀 Features

- 🔢 Fills a 3x3 matrix with ordered numbers (1 to 9)  
- 🔁 Transposes the matrix (rows become columns and vice versa)  
- 🖨️ Prints both the original and transposed matrices in a formatted way  

## 💻 Technologies Used

- C++  
- `<iostream>` for input/output  
- `<cstdlib>` for general utilities  

## 📦 How to Compile & Run

1. **Compile the code:**
   ```bash
   g++ -o matrix_transpose matrix_transpose.cpp
````

2. **Run the executable:**

   ```bash
   ./matrix_transpose
   ```

## 📌 Example Output

```
The following is a 3x3 ordered matrix : 
 1	 2	 3	
 4	 5	 6	
 7	 8	 9	


The following is a 3x3 Transposed matrix : 
 1	 4	 7	
 2	 5	 8	
 3	 6	 9	
```
